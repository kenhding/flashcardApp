## Flashcard with three-pile method

In the end, the flashcard will be presented in a flip card that can be interactive with mouse. You could press any of the three button below to start. The current version uses `the three-pile method`. 

In breif, this method involves going through the entire pile of flashcards and quizzing oneself. Flashcards that are answered perfectly are placed in the **YES pile** (`Green button`), while those that are answered incorrectly are placed in the **NO pile** (`Red button`). Flashcards that are answered with hesitation are placed in the **MAYBE pile** (`Amber button`). In a later stage, the non-YES flashcards are reviewed again until all the MAYBE/NO flashcards are moved to the YES pile.
